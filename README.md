# Deezer Export

You can use this JavaScript snippet to export a playlist on 
[Deezer](https://www.deezer.com/) to a CSV file, e.g. to import it later into
another player/service or just to make a backup.

## How to use it

1. Open Deezer website in your browser
2. Click on a playlist to view its songs
3. Open Developer Console: Go to Menu -> More Tools -> Developer Tools
4. Paste the contents of [deezer-export.js](deezer-export.js) into the console
   and hit Enter to execute the script
5. Give it a few seconds

When the script is finished running, you will be asked to download a .csv file
with song info - titles, albums, artists.
